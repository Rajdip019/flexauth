# Emails

When you start the local server with `docker` or other ways a local SMTP server starts. Generally, we use Gmail / other provider keys in the SMTP server to send emails using the provided email id. 

To know more on how to get the Keys for local setup. Check the Local setup readme. [Lcoal Setup Readme](https://github.com/Rajdip019/in-house-auth/blob/main/README.md)
